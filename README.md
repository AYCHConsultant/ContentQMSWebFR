# Coaster CMS - coasterframework
This is the codebase for Coaster CMS - all the inner workings are here and it is designed to work in conjunction with the Coaster CMS framework (https://github.com/Web-Feet/coastercms).

You can also use this as a stand alone to add CMS functionality to your project.
